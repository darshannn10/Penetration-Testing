# Target and Information Gathering Recon

Can use bugcrowd to identify a target: CHECK which clients are in scope

bugcrowd.com > find programs 

> Here: Tesla

Can check what is in scope and what is out of scope

Can see "rules" of engagement

Doman and email search using hunter.io:
https://hunter.io/search
- limit 20 searches
- Also gives us email format of company
- Can export in CSV
- Can also filter for different departments
> structure of email very important: cananticipate what someones email will be like

breach-parse by Heath (on Github): Download lists and use to collect user:password lists
- observe patterns
- understand repetitive 'offenders'
- see what users get breached a lot


**theharvester** tool
e.g. `theharvester -d tesla.com -l 500 -b google`

### Subdomains
Install "**sublist3r**"
check sublist3r -h (help to see options)

Go to **crt.sh**
- can search for `%.example.com`
- using certificate fingerprinting (looking for certificates that have been registered)

**OWASP Amass** - another great tool that combines both sublist3r and crt.sh functionalities (can download from Github)

CHALLENGE: Get it installed and use it

**tomnomnom/httprobe** > will take a list you give it and tell you which domains are alive or not


**builtwith.com** 
- can see what kind of tech, widgets and frameworks the company is running
- great resource but might be overwhelming / TMI


**Wappalyzer firefox** 
- add to firefox
- more like an active type of recon but still kind of passive
- can see live what the website is running
- can take particular version numbers of applications/tools/frameworks used and do enumeration on them to check for vulnerabilities / exploits


kali too: **whatweb**
- whatweb https://website.com
- can check what it is running, more info on versions
- headers as well
- IP addresses

**Burp suite**
- A Web Proxy
	- has the capability of intercepting traffic
- once open, go to Firefox > Preferences > Network Settings > Settings > Manual Proxy configuration 127.0.0.1 port 8080 > Use this proxy server for all protocols
- Go to https://burp (allow certificate)
- Save Burp certificate > go back to preferences > Privacy & Security > View Certificates > Import cacert.der
- this is STILL not active scanning!
- just intercepting normal traffic
- really good tool to master!!


**Google Fu**
Checkout: Google Search Operators and syntax
site:tesla.com -www -ir (take out www and ir results only get other domains)

site:tesla.com filetype:docx
site:tesla.com filetype:pdf
site:tesla.com filetype:xlsx
site:tesla.com filetype:csv

looking for potentially sensitive files / information

search for Backups!!!

**Social Media**
- LinkedIn: e.g. can find employee photos on images, can also find 'People' who work there
	- badge photos, desktops, so on
	- credential gathering
	- email addresses
	- employee information
- Twitter: badge, desk pics, software etc.
