# Installing and Updating Tools

Say you want to update the system from the terminal
```
# apt update && apt upgrade
```
It goes to the Kali repository and looks at what has changed and then asks us what to update 

**Install a specific tool** e.g. python-pip
```
# apt install python-pip
```
> actually install this as we are going to use many of these
> pip and pip3 (for python and python3)
> python 2 is deprecated

**Install from github**
to install: impacket (google github Impacket)
> find it on SecureAuthCorp
> click, clone or download (copy url)
```
# cd /opt/
# git clone URL_copied
```
> can go on Github page to fing instructions if unsure
```
# cd impacket
# pip install . 
```
> this will install all prerequisite / required libs  or python modules

Check if installed
```
# psexec.py 
```
> will autocomplete
