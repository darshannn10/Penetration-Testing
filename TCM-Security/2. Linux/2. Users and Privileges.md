# Users and Privileges

Example: 
drwxr-xr--
After 'd', rwx are the owner permissions
Members of a group that own the file have r-x
Others have r--

Owner > Group > Others

Insecure configurations might allow us to change and manipulate permissions

Can also change "default" permissions given

Can "change mode" to change file permissions
chmod u+x (adds execution permission to owner)
chmod 777 gives read, write, execute access to all
> Or chmod +x to do the same

Can add a user:
adduser john
(give password etc)

cat /etc/passwd
Can see the user we added

cat /etc/shadow
All passwords are hashed
Can use "hashcat" to reverse hash these passwords

Switch user:
su john 
su root

Can change sudoers file to allow 'john' root permission: then can use sudo in their commands to run root commands

As a low user you get lower privileges and from there try to escalate to higher privileges
