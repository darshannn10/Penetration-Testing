# More Kali commands (Network)

We use **ifconfig** to check the configuration

BUT we can also use the **iwconfig** command to check the wireless configuration

You woud see the eth0 again, the loopback, as well wireless connections like wlan0 so on

**ping** goes on forever until we Ctrl^C or something, and tests the ability to connect/communicate with a device:
\# ping IP_ADDRESS

if we get no response, the machine is either not on our network or not responding to **ICMP** traffic (Internet Control Message Protocol)

**arp -a** > going to show the IP addresses it talks to and the MAC addresses associated with them

**netstat -ano** > shows you active connections running on your machine. On a pentest, can see whether a machine is talking to somebody else (potentially someone it shouldn't talk to)

**route** > will print our routing table 
> tells us where our traffic is exiting
i.e. which ranges exit from which gateway
could be a machine with multiple routes
need to know to what networks each devices talk to and whether you can pivot from one to another
