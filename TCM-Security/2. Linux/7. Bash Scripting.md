# Bash Scripting

grep, cut, tr, for loops, script writing

for ping, can choose to do a count of 1 ping:
```
# ping IP_ADDRESS -c 1
```
grep "64 bytes"
> 64 bytes from IP_ADDRESS: icmp_seq=X ttl=Y time=Z ms
To keep the 4th field of this \# | cut -d " " -f 4
i.e we keep "IP_ADDRESS:"
We want to translate ":" > i.e. use tr -d ":" (will 'translate' the ":" into nothing as default)

**Create ipsweep.sh**:
***
```
#!/bin/bash

for ip in \`seq 1 254`; do
ping -c 1 \$1.$ip | grep "64 bytes" | cut -d " " -f 4 | tr -d ":" &
done
```
***

"&" allows for **threading**, if we didn't use it, it would have to check one ip at a time but here can do multiple

"for ip" we basically declared an "ip" variable 


"\$1" is the first use input
USAGE: **./ipsweep.sh IP_ADDRESS(first 3 octets)**
 
Save file and give executable permission
```
# chmod +x ipsweep.sh
```
Can edit script to check for input, save to file etc. e.g.:
***
```
#!/bin/bash
if [ "$1" == "" ]
then
echo "Usage: ./ipsweep.sh \<IP_first_3_octets>"
echo "Example: ./ipsweep.sh 192.168.1"

else
for ...
...
done
fi
```
***
Can add if - else statements to check for wrong input (such as an incomplete ip address)

Say we want to do an nmap for all discovered ip addressess
```
# ./ipsweep.sh IP_Address > iplist.txt
```
```
# for ip in $(cat iplist.txt); do nmap -sS -p 80 -T4 $ip & done >> scans.txt
```
