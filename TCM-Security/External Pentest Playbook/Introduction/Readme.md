## Objectives

* Key goal of an external pentest is to test security from an outside perspective.

* While breaking into the network and getting administrator access is great, the vulnerabilities found during the pentest are equally important.

* Maintain a checklist for pentesting. Examples of tasks in a checklist for an external pentest include:

  * Ensure RoE is signed by client
  * Verify customer scope
  * Conduct vulnerability scanning with Nessus
  * Validate scanning tool vulnerabilities
  * Escalate privileges from external to internal
  * Cleanup

## RoE

* Rules of Engagement document lays out a high-level overview of what is allowed and what is not allowed as an external pentester.

* It includes the roles & responsibilities for the pentest; it also mentions the scope, and out-of-scope items.

* The RoE has to be signed in order for the pentest to begin officially.

* Other aspects such as [Verification of scope](https://bgp.he.net/) and client communication are equally important.

## Attack Strategy

* External pentests are analogous to home security - lower chances of RCE, higher chances of weak passwords; OSINT is another useful technique.

* Vulnerability scanning should be one of the initial processes in an external pentest as it is a time-consuming process.

* The result of the vulnerability scan needs to be reviewed & extracted to required formats.
