# Pentest Findings

* Common pentest findings include (from high to low):

  * Insufficient authentication controls - bypassing MFA (multi-factor authentication); password spraying.

  * Weak password policy - usage of common & breached passwords; public password policies.

  * Insufficient patching - outdated software with multiple vulnerabilities.

  * Default credentials - common default credentials such as cisco:cisco and admin:admin.

  * Insufficient encryption - using HTTP instead of HTTPS; web servers using weak or moderate strength ciphers.

  * Information disclosure - possible username enumeration; revealing unnecessary info in response headers; verbose errors.

  * Username enumeration - login portal prompts; 'forgot password' feature.

  * Default web pages - default landing webpages (info disclosure).

  * Open mail relays - misconfiguration in mail servers.

  * IKE aggressive mode - possibility of getting pre-shared key; low-risk.

  * Unexpected perimeter services - unusual services enabled externally such as RDP and telnet.

  * Insufficient traffic blocking - improper geo-blocking.

  * Undetected malicious activity - ineffective SIEM strategy; network and host-based monitoring required.

  * Historical account compromises - account info present in breached data.
