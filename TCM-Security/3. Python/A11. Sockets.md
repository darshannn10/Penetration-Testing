# Sockets

port and IP address
`nc -nvlp 7777` to establish a new listening port, listening on 7777

Once we run the following script, a connection is made between our machine, back to our machine

```python
#!/bin/python3

import socket

HOST = '127.0.0.1'
PORT = 7777
s = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
#AF_INET like IPv4, SOCK_STREAM like a port

s.connect((HOST,PORT))
```
