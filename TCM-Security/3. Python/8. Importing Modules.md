# Importing Modules

Modules exist in python, many of which are built-in
Others are not built-in, so we need to import them

```
#!/bin/python3
import sys 
#system function and parameters
from datetime import datetime
print(datetime.now())
print(sys.version)
```

Could also have done
```
#!/bin/python3
from datetime import datetime as dt 
#import with alias
print(dt.now())
```
