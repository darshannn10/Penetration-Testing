# SQL Injection

- Attack in which malicious SQL statements are injected into an SQL database
- SQL injection is easy to avoid, but still happens often!
- If successful, we can read sensitive databases, extract information, modify databases, and potentially even get a shell

Common SQL Verbs

SELECT - Retrieves data from a table
INSERT - Adds data to a table
DELETE - Removes data to a table
UPDATE - Modifies data in a table
DROP - Delete a table
UNION - Combines data from multiple queries

WHERE - Filters records based on specific condition
AND/OR/NOT - Filter records based on multiple conditions
ORDER BY - Sorts records in ascending / descending order

Special character
`' and ''` - string delimiters
`--  /* and #` - comment delimiters
`* and %` - wildcards
`;` - ends SQL statement
Other that follow programmatic logic
`+ > < ( )`

Input: test
```
SQL: SELECT * FROM Users WHERE email='test';
```

Input: test'
```
SQL: SELECT * FROM Users WHERE email='test'';
```

Input: test' OR 1=1; --
```
SQL: SELECT * FROM Users WHERE email='test' OR 1=1; --';
```
everything after `--` gets commented out!

##Â Defenses
- Parameterized Statements
- Sanitizing Input
