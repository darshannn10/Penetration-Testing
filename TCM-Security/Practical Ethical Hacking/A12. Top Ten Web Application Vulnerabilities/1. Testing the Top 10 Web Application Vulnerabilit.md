# Testing the Top 10 Web Application Vulnerabilities

The OWASP Top 10 and OWASP Testing Checklist

Really cool, can find an Excel checklist 

Utilise checklist and check back in OWASP guide on how to run the tests

Followed latest tutorial to install Docker on Kali
(had to change apt-get settings to force IPv4)

After installation, installed juiceshop using docker.
Server listening on localhost 3000

We also install FoxyProxy and Burpsuite

In foxyproxy add Burp and add localhost 127.0.0.1 and port 8080
***
With Web apps, we usually have 3 stages of testing:
- Unauthenticated
- User Tier (we login as a user and have some access)
- Administrator / Admin User

When running burb can go on Site Map tab and add target to scope, then change settings to only view targets in scope

In options choose Intercept Client Request when target is in scope and same for Intercept Server Responses
