# Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

**Reflected XSS**
- inject something malicious, will get a popup or something reflected back to us. 
- Server will get a request and return it to us (it is reflected on the page)
- It will not be stored on the server
- If we leave that page and come back it won't be there unless we request it again

**Stored XSS**
- inject a malicious payload and store it on the server

**DOM XSS**
- Document Object Model (in javascript)
- Server will show us some html, js, we can exploit the js and attack specifically the DOM

***
**Reflected** example

```
index.php
<?php
$username = $_GET['username']
echo "Hi $username!";
?>
```

Say we have:
```
index.php?username=alexia
```
Hi Alexia!

```
index.php?username=<script>alert(1)</script>
```
Will generate a popup alert

GET is an insecure function

**Stored** example
E.g. leave an alert like that in a comment box. Stored on the server side and it would come up every time someone accesses the page

We can put some stored or reflected JS and steal user cookies, DoS, keylogging, etc.

For **DOM**, read article
- Source is where you would insert malicious input
- Sink is where it is executed
- this is all happening on the client side

## How to Prevent XSS

- **Encoding**
	- `< becomes &lt;`
	- `<script> becomes &lt;script>`
- **Filtering**
	- `<script> becomes script`
- **Validating**
	- Compare input against white list
- **Sanitization**
	- Combination of escaping, filtering and validation

Special note to an HTTPonly flag
prevents cookies by being observed by anauthorised parties
