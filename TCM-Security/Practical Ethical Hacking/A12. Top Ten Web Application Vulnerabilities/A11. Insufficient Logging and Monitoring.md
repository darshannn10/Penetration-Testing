# Insufficient Logging and Monitoring

Self-explanatory...

No audit of logins, failed-logins, high-value transactions

No warnings and errors generated, unclear log messages

Logs there but not monitored

Logs only stored locally

No appropirate response proceses or not effective

Scans and pen testing not triggering any alerts
