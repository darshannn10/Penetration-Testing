# Testing the Top 10 Web Application Vulnerabilities

The [OWASP Top 10](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/) and [OWASP Testing Checklist](https://owasp.org/www-project-web-security-testing-guide/assets/archive/OWASP_Web_Application_Penetration_Checklist_v1_1.pdf)

An [OWASPv4_Checklist.xlsx](https://github.com/darshannn10/Penetration-Testing/files/10301768/OWASPv4_Checklist.xlsx) 

Utilise checklist and check back in OWASP guide on how to run the tests

Followed latest tutorial to install Docker on Kali
(had to change apt-get settings to force IPv4)

After installation, installed juiceshop using docker.
Server listening on localhost 3000

We also install `FoxyProxy` and `Burpsuite`

In `foxyproxy` add `Burp` and add `localhost 127.0.0.1` and port `8080`
***
With Web apps, we usually have 3 stages of testing:
- Unauthenticated
- User Tier (we login as a user and have some access)
- Administrator / Admin User

When running burp can go on `Site Map` tab and add target to scope, then change settings to only view targets in scope

In options choose `Intercept Client Request` when target is in scope and same for `Intercept Server Responses`
