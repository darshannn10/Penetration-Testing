# Sensitive Data Exposure

- No encryption of sensitive data
- Cleartext information in source code
- Stored credentials 
- Exposed backup directories
- Publicly exposed source code and private data

All boils down to enumeration

Discovering items that shouldn't be exposed

Also check for headers
```
securityheaders.com
```

Can also scan with nmap. E.g. look at the ciphers to see how strong they are:
```
nmap --script=ssl-enum-scripts -p 443 tesla.com
```
