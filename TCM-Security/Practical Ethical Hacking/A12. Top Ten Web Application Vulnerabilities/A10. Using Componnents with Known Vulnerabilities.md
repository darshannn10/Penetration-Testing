# Using Componnents with Known Vulnerabilities

e.g. Eternal Blue, easy vulns and as well web applications 

We already know how to scan for these
e.g. out of date applications

retired java, js, other libraries

(Can scan with Burp pro)

Also, from Wappalyzer, can see what is running and what is vulnerable with that web application

Nessus to check vuln applications as well ports

Should always be patching
