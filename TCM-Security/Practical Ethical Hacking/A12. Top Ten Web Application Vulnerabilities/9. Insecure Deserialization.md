# Insecure Deserialization

**Serialization** - taking a data and forming it to be sent over 
can be serialised in xml, json, yaml, other formats to be sent over

**Deserialisation** - we take that data and deserialise it

The attack: We take something malicious and serialise it and the vulnerable application desirialises it

Web applications use these processes quite a bit

We can send the application something serialised which it will deserialise and run the exploit

Comes down to known vulnerabilities

- Do not allow serialised objects from untrusted sources

Check `ysoserial`
