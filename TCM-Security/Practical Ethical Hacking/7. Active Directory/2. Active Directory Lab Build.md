# Active Directory Lab Build

Lab
- 1 Windows Server 2019 
- 2 Windows 10 Entreprise

Min Requirements
- 60GB disk space
- 16 GB RAM

1 kali and 3 more machines: 2GB RAM for each

For Server, will use password `P@$$w0rd!` and for Users `P@$$w0rd`

Once installed, make sure to install VBox Guest additions on the Windows machine so we can go on Full Screen etc.

Renamed Server to `HYDRA-DOMAIN`
Will now install domain controller

On Server Admin page: Manage > Add Roles and Features > Next > Role-based or feature-based installation > Next > Next > Server Roles: Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) > Add Features > Next > Next > Next > Install

After installation, from Notification panel: "Promote this server to domain controller":

Add a new forest: MARVEL.local
Give it a password: P@$$w0rd
Next > Next > Next > we see the \NTDS folder > Next > Next > Install

Now, once machine reboots it will be MARVEL\Administrator
I.e. we are the Administrator of the MARVEL domain

For all machines use NAT and remove floppy from boot order

After installation, can run from Hard Disk (I think)

### Setting up Users, Groups, and Policies
On Windows Server Admin page
Tools > Active Directory Users and Computers 
MARVEL.local contains different OU folders

We currently have setup overall HYDRA-DOMAIN, CAPTAIN-DESKTOP,  THANOS-DESKTOP

RC MARVEL.local > New > Organizational Unit > Name: Groups

Move all 'Users' entries except for Administrator and Guest to 'Groups'

If we see a 'down arrow' on an account (like Guest), it means the account has been disabled

In Users > RC > New > User ... set password never expires

Accounts we set:
- captainm
- thanosg
- peterp
- SQLServ
Passwords: `Password<>1!`

Next Steps:
"File and Storage Services" > Shares > Tasks > New Share > "SMB Share - Quick" > Share name: `hackme` > Next > Next > Next > Create > Close

Now we have the `C:\Shares\hackme`

Create an SPN (Service Principle Name): CMD as Admin:
```
setspn -a HYDRA-DOMAIN/SQLServ.MARVEL.local:60111 MARVEL\SQLServ
```

Next step:
```
setspn -T MARVEL.local -Q */*
```

On windows: Group Policy Management
On MARVEL.local > "Create a GPO in this domain, and Link it here..."
(Group Policy Object) > Name: Disable Windows Defender 

We will not be going through disabling antivirus etc.
Most of this course will work without AV evasion (which keeps on changing all the time anyways)

RC on new policy > Edit > Computer Configuration > Policies > Admin Templates > Windows Components > Windows Defender Antivirus > Turn off Windows Defender Antivirus > Double Click > Enabled > Apply > Ok

Once we join our user machines to our Domain machine, Windows Defender will be unavailable to them 

## Joining our machines to the Domain
For both machines

On local disk `C:` create a new folder called `Share`
Properties > Sharing > Share > Yes

On Server: find IP `ipconfig` > our ip is 10.0.2.15

On Windows machine: Internet access > Network & Internet access > Change adapter options

RC Ethernet > Properties > Double Click IPv4
Use the following DNS server addresses (enter IP of Domain Controller)

From search: "domain" > Access work or school > Connect > Join this device to a local Active Directory domain > MARVEL.local > Join as Administrator

Now, can log in as Other user: captainm
This time, we log in as this user 

Final setting changes: Actually sign out and sign in as MARVEL\Administrator
we want to enable our user (here captainm) to be a local administrator on this machine (for second user, try login as thanosg)

On Machine: Computer Management > Local Users and Groups > Groups > Administrators > Add: captainm (Check names) > Apply > Okay
(same for thanosg)
(on Thanos machine, also add captainm as a local admin)

So, captainm is local admin on both machines

Our Setup: 
- Windows New: captainm - CAPTAIN-DESKTOP
- Windows Second: thanosg - THANOS-DESKTOP
- Windows Server: MARVEL.local - HYDRA-DOMAIN

From the Server, on AD Users and Groups, we can  go to Computers and refresh to see that the machines have now been added and have joined our domain

# NEW SETUP

### Server and DC 
```
HYDRA-DC P@$$w0rd!
```

Added MARVEL.local to the DC
DSRM pass same as HYDRA-DC

W1 - Frank Castle: password1 (10.10.10.5) - `\\DARTHVADER`
W2 - Zoe Park: password2 (10.10.10.4) - `\\SPOCK`

Created SPN (service principle name) on DC

fcastle@MARVEL.local - Password1 - Local Admin
> to log into admin from frankcastle: `marvel\administrator`
Enabled FC to be local admin on his machine and ZP's machine

zpark@MARVEL.local - Password2 - Domain Admin
pparker@MARVEL.local - Password3
SQL Acc. Admin: SQLService@MARVEL.local - MYpass123!

Share: hackme
` C:\Share\hackme`

Copied pparker from admin account to have the same privileges

Had issues with computer devices showing up on the shared network
On Windows Services started (or ensured are running):
- Function Discovery Provider Host
- Function Discovery Resource Publication

fcastle is a local admin on W1 and W2
zpark is a local admin on W2

Both fcastle and zpark are simple users

pparker and SQLService have a Domain administrator role
