# Active Directory Overview: Physical and Logical components

**Active Directory**:
- Directory service developed by Microsoft to manage Windows domain networks 
- Stores information related to objects, such as Computers, Users, Printers etc.
- Authenticates using Kerberos tickets
	- Non-Windows devices such as Linux machines, firewalls, etc. can also authenticate to Active Directory via RADIUS or LDAP

Eg. with Active Directory you can use the same credentials to authenticate yourself throughout different applications (e.g. laptop, email so on), using Kerberos tickets

Active Directory - most commonly used identity management service in the world 
- 95% of FT1000 implement the service in their networks 
- Can be exploited, without ever attacking patchable exploits
	- by abusing features, trusts, components and more 
- It comes a lot down to policies

Super important for **internal** PT

Important in terms of internal locks

## Physical Active Directory Components 

### Domain Controllers
A **domain controller** is a server with the **AD DS server** role installed that has specifically been promoted to a domain controller

**AD DS => Active Directory Domain Services directory store**:

**Domain Controllers**
- host a copy of the AD DS directory store 
- provide authentication and authorization services
- replicate updates to other domain controllers in the domain and forest
	- when you make an update in one domain, it updates in all others across the board
- allow administrative access to manage user accounts and network resources
	- can add computers, add/remove/update policies so on. 

Compromising the Domain Controller can lead to us controlling the network 

Think beyond getting admin, such as compromising PII etc. 

### AD DS Data Store
Containts the database files and processes that store and manage directory information for users, services, and applications 
- consists of the **Ntds.dit** file
	- this file contains everything that is stored in AD data!
	- all users, access, groups, password hashes etc.!
- stored by default in the **%SystemRoot%\NDTS** folder on all domain controllers 
- accessible only through the domain controller processes and protocols 

## Logical Active Directory Components
### AD DS Schema
- Defines every type of object that can be stored in the directory 
- Enforces rules regarding object creation and configuration

### Domains
Used to group and manage objects in an organization 
- an administrative boundary for applying policies to groups and objects 
- a replication boundary for replicating data between domain controllers 
- an authentication and authorization boundary that provides a way to limit the scope of access to resources

So we have one domain and it functions like a domain controller 
Similar to the domain controller except now we are managing everything through a domain  e.g. example.com, not very different to building it out in our network 

### Trees
A domain tree is a hierarchy of domain in AD DS
All domains in the tree:
- share a contiguous namespace with the parent domain 
- can have additional child domains 
- by default create a two-way transitive trust with other domains 

E.g. can have a parent domain and two child domains:

I.e. the tree is the parent-children 

### Forests 
A collection of one or more domain trees:

Forests:
- share a common schema
- share a common configuration partition 
- share a common global catalog to enable searching 
- enable trusts between all domains in the forest 
- share the Entreprise Admins and Schema Admins group

Domain > Tree > Forest

In this class, we will mostly be working with Domains

Inside of AD there are Organisational Units 

## Organizational Units (OUs) 
Active Directory containers that can contain users, groups, computers and other OUs

Used to:
- represent your organization hierarchically and logically 
- manage a collection of objects in a consistent way 
- delegate permissions to administer groups of objects
- apply policies 

### Trusts
How we have access between resources
- provide a mechanism for users to gain access to resources in another domain 

![](https://github.com/Cyberd0xed/practical-ethical-hacking/blob/main/resources/a808fb904a92492dbb612676c44a3716.png?raw=true)

- all domains in a forest trust all other domains in the same forest
- trusts can extend outside the forest 

### Objects
What is going to be inside our OUs
