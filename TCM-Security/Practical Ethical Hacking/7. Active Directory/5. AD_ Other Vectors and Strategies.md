# AD: Other Vectors and Strategies 

## Strategies
- Begin the day with mitm6 or Responder (in the morning and around lunchtime)
- Run scans to generate traffic (usually nessus, nmap)
- If scans are taking too long, look for websites in scope (http_version)
	- Or also if you are trying to be quiet (e.g. use http_version in Metasploit to see if anything responds to http_version. It is less likely to be picked up as we are making traffic on 80 and 443)
- Look for default credentials on web logins
	- Printers (usually have scan features e.g. many admins make printers domain admin..)
	- Jenkins
	- Etc
- Think outside the box
