# cPassword / GPP Attacks

## GPP (AKA MS14-025)
Group Policy Preferences allow admins to create policies using embedded credentials

These credentials were encrypted and placed in an XML document and were stored in this type called "cPassword"

cPassword was encrypted but key was accidentally released (therefore we can decrypt the credentials)

This was patched in MS14-025 but doesn't prevent issues with previous us

If an admin has stores a GPP before the patch was implemented then this will still display a credential to us 

Does not come often but still a problem (eg. for 2012 Servers)

How to check for this: msf smb_enum_gpp module

Instead of the lab, we will test this on HTB (machine '**Active**')

## Hacking Active

```
sudo nmap -T5 10.10.10.100
```

When we scan against a DC we expect to see something like port 53 domain open, and that could be a router as well, but we also expect to see 88 (kerberos) open, as well as lpad (389) and ldapssl (636), so it seems it is a DC

On top of this, we have 445 open (microsoft-ds). The attack involves utilising SMB so we will try and found out more for that more.
Usually in SMB there are SYSVOL folders

```
sudo smbclient -L \\\\10.10.10.100\\
```

SYSVOL works by storing the groups.xml file. That is where we find the cPassword. This is were the GPP comes into play. 

After trying to log in, we find we can anonymously access the Replication folder. From there do 'prompt off'

```
sudo smbclient \\\\10.10.10.100\\Replication
```
```
smb: \> prompt off
```
> just tells it to not prompt us when we download files

```
smb: \> recurse on
```
> it will download all the files we tell it to

We `ls` to see the different files, we see that the `Groups.xml` file is there

We can get all files by doing: `smb: \> mget *`

We open the Groups.xml file and see that we have the cPassword which we can now decrypt. We also have active.htb which is the domain name and SVC_TGS, seems this is the TGS account (active.htb\SVC_TGT)

![gpp-4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/87711310/209465468-90f620ec-2068-4408-981e-0b89aa01dfac.png)

Copy the cPassword and use gpp decrypt:
```
gpp-decrypt ekdfaknjfd...sadfh
```

We get the password

Now we have both the username active.htb\svc_tgs and their password GPPstillStandingStrong2k18


Kerberoasting applicable!!!

I ran
```
sudo GetUserSPNs.py active.htb/svc_tgs:GPPstillStandingStrong2k18 -dc-ip 10.10.10.100 -request
```

Got the krb5tgs (OF course!! it is a server!!) and decrypted it with hashcat. Got Administrator password: Ticketmaster1968
