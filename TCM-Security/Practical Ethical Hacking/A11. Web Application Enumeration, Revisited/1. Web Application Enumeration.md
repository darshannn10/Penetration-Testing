# Web Application Enumeration

Will cover additional tools than what we learned in the beginning

## Go
Download Go language

```
sudo tar -xvf go1.15.2.linux-amd64.tar.gz -C /usr/local
```

Change owner
```
sudo chown -R root:root /usr/local/go/
```

Need to make sure our paths are set correctly

gedit ~/.profile

Add in the end:
```
export GOPATH=$HOME/go
export PATH=$PATH:$GOPATH/bin
```

Actually issues with that. Instead, do following:
Edit ~/.bashrc and add
```
export GOPATH=$HOME/go
export GOROOT=/usr/local/go
export PATH=$PATH:$GOROOT/bin:$GOPATH/bin
```
Save and type `source ~/.bashrc`
