# Amass

Amass by OWASP

Go to github 'Installation Page' and follow the "From Source" instructions to install

We are again going to build it into a script

Amass does take some time..

The way we run it:
```
amass enum -d tesla.com
```

We can add it to our script (even though it takes a long time) like this:

```
echo "[+] Harvesting subdomains with Amass..."
amass enum -d $url >> $url/recon/f.txt
sort -u $url/recon/f.txt >> $url/recon/final.txt
rm $url/recon/f.txt
```
