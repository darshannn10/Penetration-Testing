# Httprobe

httprobe by tomnomnom

Can see which subdomains are actually alive/responsive

```
cat tesla.com/recon/final.txt | httprobe
```
Makes an http and https request.

No matter the response code, it reports it back signalling it is alive

Can narrow this down
```
cat tesla.com/recon/final.txt | httprobe -s
```
`-s` is going to remove all the default ports 
it is scanning at 80 and 443
Heath has automatic DNS on port 80 so sets:
```
cat tesla.com/recon/final.txt | httprobe -s -p https:443 
```
to avoid false positives

More

```
cat tesla.com/recon/final.txt | httprobe -s -p https:443 | sed 's/https\?:\/\///' | tr -d ':443' 
```

this will remove the https from the front and trim :443 from our results

We add this to our script
```
echo "[+] Probing for alive domains..."
cat $url/recon/final.txt | sort -u | httprobe -s -p https:443 | sed 's/https\?:\/\///' | tr -d ':443' >> $url/recon/alive.txt
```
