# Assetfinder

For finding subdomains

by tomnomnom

```
go get -u github.com/tomnomnom/assetfinder
```

E.g.

```
assetfinder tesla.com >> tesla-subs.txt
```

we get around 347 results
Not only finding the subs but also assets related to tesla. 

If we only want subdomains strictly:
```
assetfinder --subs-only tesla.com
```

Usually better to just run the first one and grep out the subdomains

Can write a tool to do that:
```
#!/bin/bash

url=$1

if [ ! -d "$url"];then
	mkdir $url
fi

if [ ! -d "$url/recon"];then
	mkdir $url/recon
fi

assetfinder $url >> $url/recon/assets.txt
cat $url/recon/assets.txt | grep $1 >> $url/recon/final.txt
# if we also want to remove the file including the other domains:
rm $url/recon/assets.txt

```
