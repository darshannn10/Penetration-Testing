# Post-Compromise Enumeration: Bloodhound

## Bloodhound 

```
sudo apt install bloodhound
```

Need to configure neo4j (installed along with bloodhound)
```
sudo neo4j console
```
Connect to localhost port and login with default creds 'neo4j' username and pass. We set password 'password'. Leave that on and then run `sudo bloodhound` on another terminal tab.

Login with neo4j to the bloodhound platform. Now, to use bloodhound we need first to pull data. Will do that with an injester.

There is "Invoke-Bloodhound" from powershell, "Sharphound" (in C#) and others in python

Search for: Invoke-bloodhound

Download SharpHound and run Invoke-Bloodhound function

Put that on our Windows machine.

On Windows
```
C:\Users\fcastle\Downloads> powershell -ep bypass
PS C:\Users\fcastle\Downloads> . .\SharpHound.ps1
PS C:\Users\fcastle\Desktop > Invoke-Bloodhound -CollectionMethod All -Domain MARVEL.local -ZipFileName file.zip
```
After the operation has completed, move that file over to the Kali machine to upload to our Bloodhound platform 

Go on Bloodhound platform and upload the zip file as is from 'Upload Data'

Can run many various queries... a lot of automatic reports and graphics!!!
