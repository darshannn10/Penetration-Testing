# Starting and Stopping Services

Services
> for instance: a webserver, or ssh, or a SQL database etc.

**Apache2** > a web server
> do ifconfig and copy our IP address, paste the address on a browser and see that nothing is running on it
```
# service apache2 start
```
> will start the default web server and now we can see it running on our IP on a browser
> when we boot our machine this apache service is not running by default
> Message: if we want to edit or add files to it, need to edit the /var/www/html folder

We can even put files on the /var/www/html and host them there for other people to download...

but we can do that a "better way":
```
# python -m SimpleHTTPServer \<port> (typically 80 or 8080)
```
> can run this at the folder/dir we want to make available
```
# service apache2 stop
```

How to spin up a service permanently
> When we start a service, it only runs for the current session and stops once the session is terminated

Keeping something running the entire time:
```
# systemctl [enable/disable] [ssh/postgresql/...]
```
> This will e.g. enable postgresql every time we reboot
> Important for us to run Metasploit for example, so won't take extra time for Metasploit to load
