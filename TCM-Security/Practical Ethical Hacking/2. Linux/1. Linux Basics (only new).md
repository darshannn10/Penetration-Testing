# Linux Basics 
(not a very detailed entry, just briefly writing what was mentioned..)

``` ls, pwd, cd, TAB, mkdir, rmdir, cp, mv, rm ...```

`ls` -> lists contents inside a directory

`la` -> displays information about the user, size of the file, and date and time of modification

echo "Hi!" > text.txt

\# locate file

updatedb

passwd - to change user password 

man ls

can use: `command` --help

It now feels like there is not much of a point in this note.. :')

haven't noted down much because i already know all the stuff, however, you can visit Linux from [here](https://www.linuxtrainingacademy.com/linux-commands-cheat-sheet/)
