#Variables and Methods
```python3
quote = "All is fair in love and war."

print(quote)
```

---

Methods = functions that are available for a given object
e.g. 
```python3
print(quote.upper())
print(quote.lower())
print(quote.title())

Upper: ALL IS FAIR IN LOVE AND WAR.
Lower: all is fair in love and war.
Title: All Is Fair In Love And War.
```

```python
print(len(quote))

name = "Alex" #string
age = 21 #int
gpa = 12.3 #float

print(int(age))
print(int(30.1)) # will always round down, never up 
print("My name is " + name + " and I am " + str(age) + " years old.")

age += 1

Output: 22
```
