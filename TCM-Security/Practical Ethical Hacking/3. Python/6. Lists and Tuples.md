# Lists and Tuples

## Lists
Data structures, you can order the **items** in them, live in between brackets [ ]

```python
movies = ["The Avatar", "Inception", "Portait of a Lady on Fire", "12 Angry men"]

print(movies[0]) #start with 0 like arrays
print(movies[1])
print(movies[3])
print(movies[1:4]) #stops at 4th item
print(movies[1:]) #stops at end of list
print(movies[:1]) #stops before 1, so shows movie0
print(movies[:2]) #shows first 2 items of list
print(movies[-1]) #print final item
print(len(movies)) #prints number of items on list

#Can also append movies
movies.append("20th Century Women") #adds to end of list
movies.pop() #removes last item of list
#Can also do
movies.pop(0) #remove first item of list
```
***
## Tuples

Are like lists but immutable, cannot change them, have parenthesis
```
grades = ("A", "B", "C", "D", "E", "F")
```
Cannot append, pop etc.

Once it is defined and set, that's it
