# Subnetting

## Part 1 - Methodology

Do an `ifcongif` and see `IP` and `netmask`
Example:
`inet 192.168.57.139 netmask 255.255.255.0`

`netmask` = `subnet mask` = `subnet`

`255.255.255.0` = `11111111.11111111.11111111.00000000`

255.255.255.0 known as a `/24` network (`slash/whack 24 network`)
This allows for `2^8` = `256` hosts
> calculated based on how many bits are switched off
`/24` bits are turned on, while 8 are turned off (total 32!)

`Class C` `/24` allows for 256-2 = `254` hosts. Very common for a household or a small business

```
/8 = 255.0.0.0
/16 = 255.255.0.0
/24 = 255.255.255.0
/32 = 255.255.255.255
```

`Subnetting` - how many hosts can we fit and what is the mask that goes behind them?

`Network ID` - what is typically your "first address"
`Broadcast ID` - typically your "last address"
> not always, but very common
