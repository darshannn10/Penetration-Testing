# TCP, UDP, and the Three-way-Handshake 

**TCP vs UDP**

TCP = Transmission Control Protocol 
-> A **connection-oriented** protocol

UDP = User Datagram Protocol
-> a **connection-less** protocol

When we have these two protocols, TCP is better suited to when it comes to high reliability (For example for a connection to a website using http or https, or ssh or ftp to transfer files reliably)

while UDP can be used for streaming, VoIP (Voice-over IP), DNS, that are connection-less 

These are important when it comes to **scanning**

We will most commonly be scanning TCP
TCP works on what is called a **three-way handshake**:

We first send a **SYN** packet
We receive back a **SYN-ACK** packet
We send back an **ACK** packet
> works like an interaction

We connect to a specific **port**. To do so, need to establish the 3-way handshake. (Total **65,535** ports)

We send a SYN packet saying we want to connect to a system on a particular port. They will send back a SYN and an ACKnowledgement

Can view all data packets sent pack and forth when establishing a connection, by logging traffic using **Wireshark**

We send the ACK packet back if we indeed want to finalise / establish the connection
