# Cleanup

Make the system/network as it was when you entered it
- Remove executables, scripts, and added files
- Remove malware, rootkits, and added user accounts
- Set settings back to original configurations 

make it look like you were never there
In red teaming, you want to remove yourself from logs
Clean the logs, like you were never there 

(not so much for pentesters but mostly for red teams)
