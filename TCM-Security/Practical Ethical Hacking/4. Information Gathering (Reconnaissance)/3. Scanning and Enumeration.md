# Scanning and Enumeration

Installing a vulnerable VM: Kioptrix
- Give it a NAT setting (not bridge)
- And 256 memory
- (from settings)
- open Kioptrix configuration file > ctrl+f to find 'bridged' (unclick 'Match case') change to 'NAT' or 'nat'
> Then can run on VMWare and 'I copied it'

Kioptrix Level 1 password:
- Username:john Pass: TwoCows2

Like netdiscover, can use `arp-scan -l` in linux to do the same > try to find the 'VirtualBox' machine running

`netdiscover -r IP/24` using arp to sweep the whole subnet

## nmap
- to scan for open ports
- Can use `-sS` for stealth mode (but this is now default anyway)
- Stealth scan used to be stealhy, undetectable but **no longer so**
- i.e. **NOT STEALTHY**

How it works: SYN SYNACK RST (Instead of ACK)
> i.e. connection not established
By SYNACK, port reveals it is open to establish a connection. But we don't follow through with it hence "Stealth"

`nmap -T4 -p- -A`
- `-T4` symbolizes medium speed
- `-p-` stands for scanning all ports
- `-p` scans 1000 most common ports
- `-p 443, 53` can scan for specific ports
- `-A` scan and tell us everything (all info)
- `-sn` can do a ping sweep (ping scan) of network
- `-Pn` maybe host is acting as offline but is not actually offline. I.e. treat hosts as online even if they are not responding to pings etc. 
- `-sS` stealth scan / TCP SYN scan 
- `-sU` for UDP scan (super slow, takes forever)

- `sV` probe open ports to determine service / version info
- `-O` enable OS detection
- `-sC` default Scan
- BUT, `-A` just does all of this for us: OS detection, version detection, script scanning, and traceroute 

Can even write a script to do the scanning

When we do client enumeration, we usually scan and at the same time review other info. Want to look at the open ports and check what is running on them. 

The OS is not always definitive and as shown in the Scan results.

Need to look for information on the open ports and find exploits for them.

## Enumerating HTTP/HTTPs

Historically, 443, 80 and 139 have had exploits.
E.g 443 ssl/https and 80 http

Go back to browser, and head to IP's website
not only http but also https

We see the default webpage - a **finding** > tells us a little bit about the architecture running **also** are there other directories running? OR if not, why did they just leave the default page up? Bad hygiene

Click on link > instead 404 page it leads us to a "Not found" page that also discloses the Apache version (i.e. now confirmed)

Use **nikto** for vulnerability scanning
`nikto -h host_IP`

Typically, DoS is out of scope when doing security assessments, possible code execution of interest, remote buffer overflow and remote shells of interest 

## Directory Busting
Can use **dirbuster**, can use **dirb**, can use **gobuster** 
> Heath recommends dirbuster

run it: #dirbuster &
Set host (and port): http://10.0.2.15:80/
Click "Go Faster" on thread options
Then "Browse" for file of dirs/files > go to /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/... can choose the 'small' list 
if we don't find anything at all can move to 'medium' etc.
Have hundred / thousands of directory names
- It is going to go out and navigate to these, check if they exist

Can also look for specific file extentions
> for example, now that we are against an Apache website, we know it is running PHP so can check for that
> Microsoft server usually runs asp or aspx
> Need to know what is running on the back-end and make use of it

Can add to that file extention:
E.g. `php,txt,zip,rar,pdf,docx...`
> the more we add the longer this will take...

Leave it running: Can check both 'results' and 'tree' view
Can even enumerate the files / directories found

Can right click on these and open in browser

Also, make sure to 'View Source Code' of the websites
- looking for anything that shouldn't be disclosed there
- comments that disclose information
- passwords, usernames, keys, etc.


While waiting, can open Burb (and set ON Burp proxy again)
- Reload page and set repeater ON
- Can send different results/request and/or modify what you send 
- Can go to "Scope" tab and add the IP to 'Add prefix for URLs you want to add'
> e.g. http://10.0.2.15
> Limits the search to 'in-scope items'
"Server" header provides us with further information (confirms nikto scan)
i.e. we find a couple of "information disclosure" problems


Back to **dirbuster**
- we are looking for interesting directories
- can also see "Response Code"
- "200" means okay
- "400" (4**) refers to some error
- "300" typically a redirect

After getting our results, go to each domain and check for version and other interesting information

## Enumerating SMB - Samba
A File share
- commonly used in work and private environments
- couple of exploits previously no SMB. Outdated versions prone to exploitation

Previously, nmap -A also ran a couple of scripts / enumeration. In our case, it found an smb2-time failed protocol negotiation. Can see it is running SMB2 but we need to confirm that information

## Metasploit
make it default for postgresql to start automatically when we boot our system: `service start postgresql`

start Metasploit: `msfconsole`
**auxiliary** modules - for scanning and enumeration 
- can do port scanning, all kinds of information gathering with these auxiliary modules

**post** modules - for post exploitation 

`msf> search smb`
look at syntax: `auxiliary/type_of_module/...`
Also, version information mentioned at some e.g. /smb2

One result: `auxiliary/scanner/smb/smb_version`

Try: `msf> use auxiliary/scanner/smb/smb_version` OR `msf> use 61`

Then look at more information: `msf auxiliary(scanner/smb/smb_version) > info`
`msf auxiliary(scanner/smb/smb_version) > options`

We are presented with some ITEMS
e.g. RHOSTS == remote hosts >> always the 'victim', who we are targeting. If RHOST, we can only specify one host, not multiple

LHOST == localhost

`set RHOSTS 10.0.2.15` then `run`
```
[*] 10.0.2.15:139 - Host could not be identified: Unix (**Samba 2.2.1a**)`
[*] 10.0.2.15:445 - Scanned 1 of 1 hosts (100% complete)
[*] Auxiliary module execution completed
```
Can now do more research on the SMB version

## smbclient
- will attempt to connect to the fileshare
- if we manage to get access, we can see what files are on the server --> might have some important files!!
- `-L` to list all files, 4 slashes: `\\\\IP\\`
- \'s just character escaping 
- `smbclient -L \\\\10.0.2.15\\`
We don't know the password, just hit ENTER

Problem: `NT_STATUS_IO_TIMEOUT`
edit `/etc/samba/smb.conf`
Add under global:
```bash
client min protocol=CORE
client max protocol=SMB3
```
We get some "sharename" Servers like: ADMIN$, IPC$

Try to connect to ADMIN:
`smbclient \\\\10.0.2.15\\ADMIN$`
But we don't have the password, so it won't let us connect

Try to connect to IPC:
`smbclient \\\\10.0.2.15\\IPC$`
`smb: \>`
Can type help to view available commands: `smb: \> help`
`smb: \> ls` to list the files etc. similar to terminal
We get:
```smb: \> ls
NT_STATUS_NETWORK_ACCESS_DENIED listing \*
```
- kind of a dead end here...
`smb: \> exit`


## Enumerating SSH
We had 22/tcp open ssh port: OpenSSH 2.9p2 (protocol 1.99)
Attempt to connect to it, to check / confirm version
`# ssh IP_Address`
But this is an old machine. Need to do following
```
# ssh IP_Address -oKexAlgorithms=+diffie-hellman-group1-sha1
```
We get another error, asking us for a cipher
```
# ssh IP_Address -oKexAlgorithms=+diffie-hellman-group1-sha1 -c aes128-cbc`
```
> Can now connect. It will prompt us for password

We just do Ctrl+C to leave/exit (not even ENTER)
reason we tried this:
- sometimes a banner is exposed when attempting a connection, that might provide us with more information regaring the SSH version
> Nevertheless, we got the version through scanning
> Will have to 'hammer it' further, later on using exploits / brute force ...

## Researching potential vulnerabilities

Check our "findings" file

"Juiciest" first. Here: port 80, 443 and SMB
E.g. Google: (for 443) mod_ssl 2.8.4 exploit
---> There is an exploit for it Remote Buffer Overflow
80/443 potentially vulnerable to 'OpenLuck'
'Cheat' the exploitDB is outdated but there is a Github one that works

Can also research, Apache 1.3.20 exploits --> check their scores...high score == red == critical

Samba 2.2.1a exploit --> we get a few: buffer overflow, remote code execution, One from rapid7 (by metasploit)
--> also shows us module options on metasploit, what to use
potentially vulnerable to trans2open

Just copy/paste the links of exploits

Another way instead of Google. From terminal **searchsploit**

e.g. `searchsploit Samba 2` do not be too specific as it is looking for exact scripts 

Do more research for the rest (Webalizer etc.)

CVEdetails.com pretty useful!


## Additional Scanning Tools

### masscan
e.g. `masscan -p1-65535 10.0.2.15`
BUT nmap finishes much faster ...
But on masscan can specify --rate 1000

### Metasploit Scanning
`msfconsole`
`msf> search portscan`
Syn scanner is similar to the stealth scan 
`> use auxiliary/scanner/portscan/syn`
`> options`
check requirements, and set rhosts
can also set ports 1-65535
`> run`
> kind of slow, not much detail
Can also `set threads 100` or some other number, so that it runs faster 

### Nessus - A Vulnerability scanner
`dpkg -i Nessus-8.10.1-debian6_amd64.deb`

Nessus (pass: D-a-4-0!) 

Once installed and logged in:
`Create new scan`
Free Nessus version: Can scan against any private IP address
Up to 16 at one time

--> Can even schedule a scan (say client wants to scan after a particular hour, so we can schedule for that instead of having to run it manually)

Discovery > Scan Type > Can scan all ports
Assessment > Scan Type > Choose for what vulnerabilities / exploits to scan
Report > Can Customise
Advanced > Usually Default

Can also create a new scan, 'Advanced Scan'
--> Really cool! Can specify on scanning what type of Ping to do, what protocols to send, and more.
> more options and more control

We usually report Critical and High vulnerabilities
Also, make sure to download report 

Heath has paid for: BurpSuite Pro and Nessus Pro
