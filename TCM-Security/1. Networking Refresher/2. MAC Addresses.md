# MAC Addresses

**MAC** or **physical** address
MAC = Medium Access Control 
Can be found at **ether** under ifconfig

If we have a device and have installed our Network Interface Card (**NIC**), we plug that in and we are going to have a MAC address for that NIC.

Anything using a network interface is going to have a MAC

These MAC addresses utilise Layer 2 (or Switching) and they are how we communicate over **Switches**

MAC addresses have **identifiers**

Example > 00:0c:29:0a:42:05
First three
> 00:0c:29
Can copy and paste that in a 'MAC Address Lookup'
Will tell us the vendor!

First three number pairs are 'identifiers' that can help us identify the device
