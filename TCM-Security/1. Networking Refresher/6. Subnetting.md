# Subnetting

## Part 1 - Methodology

Do an ifcongif and see IP and netmask
Example:
inet 192.168.57.139 netmask 255.255.255.0

netmask = subnet mask = subnet

255.255.255.0 = 11111111.11111111.11111111.00000000

255.255.255.0 known as a /24 network (slash/whack 24 network)
This allows for 2^8 = 256 hosts
> calculated based on how many bits are switched off
/24 bits are turned on, while 8 are turned off (total 32!)

Class C /24 allows for 256-2 = 254 hosts. Very common for a household or a small business

/8 = 255.0.0.0
/16 = 255.255.0.0
/24 = 255.255.255.0
/32 = 255.255.255.255

Subnetting - how many hosts can we fit and what is the mask that goes behind them?

Network ID - what is typically your "first address"
Broadcast ID - typically your "last address"
> not always, but very common
