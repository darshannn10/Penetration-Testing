# IP Addresses

**ifconfig** to view our IP address

**inet** - which is our IPv4 address (in decimal notation)
**inet6** - which is out IPv6 address (in hexadecimal notation)

IP address - part of Layer 3 of OSI model

Example: 192.168.57.139
first **octet**: 192 is a range of 1's and 0's
> when all made up, this inet is made up of 32 bits (4 bytes)
128	 64	 32	 16	 8	 4	 2	 1 

128 + 64 = 192
128 + 32 + 8 = 168
32 + 16 + 4 = 52
128 + 8 + 2 + 1 = 139

192.168.57.139 => 11000000.10101000.00110100.10001011 in binary


With IPv4, we have 32 bits, so a total of 2^32 = around 4 billion range of possible addresses. This is not enough (world population around 7.6 billion)

IPv6 is in 128 bits, 2^128 i.e. around 3 to the 38th power!
But still to this day everyone is using IPv4...
How?

Using **NAT** - Network Address Translation

Everything that starts with 192.168 is not a public IP address (rather private)

private IP addresses can be then passed on to public ones

Class C usually for small company / home networks

A massive company might use a Class A (i.e. 10.0.0.0 to 10.255.255.255)

Can purchase those IP ranges / addresses from your local ISP (Internet Service Provider)

IPv4 and IPv6 are Layer 3 Protocols (usually Layer 3 **Router**)
